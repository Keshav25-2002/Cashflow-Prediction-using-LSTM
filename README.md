# Cashflow-Prediction-using-LSTM

This project is a deep learning model built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict future cashflows for a business based on historical data. The model is 

trained on a dataset of past cashflows, and it can predict future cashflows with a high degree of accuracy.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

Date
Revenue
Expenses
Cashflow

Model:

The model is built using LSTM, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can process sequential data. The model is trained on the past cashflow data to 

learn the patterns and relationships between the different features. Once trained, the model can predict future cashflows based on the current and past data.

Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas Library

TensorFlow Library

Keras Library

Scikit-Learn Library

Installation:

pip install pandas

pip install tensorflow

pip install keras

pip install scikit-learn

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using LSTM to predict future cashflows for a business. By leveraging the power of deep learning, we were able to build a 

model that can accurately predict future cashflows based on past data. This model can be extended to include more features and can be used by businesses to better 

forecast their financial performance.
